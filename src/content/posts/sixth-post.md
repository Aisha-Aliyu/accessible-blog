# Designing for Readability

Text contrast is essential for readability, especially for visually impaired users. WCAG guidelines provide specific ratios to ensure text is legible.

## Practical Tips

- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast for normal text.  
- Minimum 3:1 contrast for large text.  
- Avoid relying on color alone to convey information.

<Highlight code={`.text { color: #0f172a; background: #ffffff; }`} language="css" />

### Takeaway

Readable text benefits all users. Use accessible colors and test with tools like contrast checkers.
