# Semantic HTML: Building a Meaningful Structure

Semantic HTML communicates meaning to both browsers and assistive technologies. This improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

## Examples

- Use <header>, <main>, <footer> instead of generic `<div>`s.  
- Use <nav> for site navigation.  
- Use <article> and <section> for content grouping.

<Highlight code={`<header><h1>Blog Title</h1></header><main><article><p>Content</p></article></main>`} language="html" />

## Benefits

- Helps screen readers understand page structure.  
- Boosts search engine understanding.  
- Makes future maintenance easier.

### Takeaway

Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessible, SEO-friendly websites.
