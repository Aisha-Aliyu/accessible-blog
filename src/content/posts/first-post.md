# Welcome to my Accessible Blog

Accessibility is no longer optional—it's a must for modern websites. Making your web apps usable for everyone improves reach, usability, and overall user satisfaction. In this post, I’ll cover the basics of accessibility and how to get started.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Many users rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, or keyboard navigation. If your website isn't designed with accessibility in mind, these users may not be able to use it at all. Accessibility benefits everyone, including users with temporary disabilities, older users, and even mobile users on small screens.

## Practical Tips

- ✅ Use semantic HTML (`<header>`, <main>, `<nav>`).  
- ✅ Add alt text for images to describe visual content.  
- ✅ Ensure keyboard navigation works across all interactive elements.

<Highlight code={`<button className="focus-visible:ring-2">Click Me</button>`} language="js" />

### Takeaway

Accessibility isn’t just a technical requirement—it’s part of creating inclusive, professional websites.
