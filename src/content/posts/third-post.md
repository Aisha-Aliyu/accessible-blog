# Creating Forms Everyone Can Use

Forms are a critical part of web applications. A poorly accessible form can prevent users from completing a task, like signing up or making a purchase. This post explores strategies to make forms inclusive.

## Best Practices

- Use labels for inputs so screen readers can read the form fields.  
- Provide error messages and validation feedback.  
- Ensure logical tab order for keyboard users.

<Highlight code={`<label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>\n<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />`} language="tsx" />

## Advanced Tips

- Use aria-live regions for real-time validation feedback.  
- Group related inputs with <fieldset> and <legend> for better context.  
- Avoid placeholder-only labels; they disappear when typing.

### Takeaway

Accessible forms are critical for inclusivity and conversion. Every input counts.
