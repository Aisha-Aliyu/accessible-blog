# Navigating Without a Mouse

Not all users use a mouse. Keyboard navigation ensures users can access all interactive elements efficiently.

## Tips

- Use tabindex carefully to maintain logical order.  
- Implement visible focus styles.  
- Use skip links to bypass repetitive content.

<Highlight code={`<a href="#main" className="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>`} language="html" />

### Takeaway

Keyboard accessibility is essential for inclusivity. Test by navigating your site without a mouse.
